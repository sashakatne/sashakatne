- 👋 Hi, I’m @sashakatne
- 👀 I’m interested in: Exploring the fascinating world of computer engineering, especially the synergy between hardware and software. I am passionate about AI-enhanced silicon design, pre-silicon validation, and computer architecture. My goal is to innovate and optimize how software interacts with hardware.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning: Delving deep into the intricacies of System Verilog, Microprocessor System Design, Computer Architecture, and the fundamentals of Pre-Silicon Validation. Additionally, I am enhancing my skills in Python and other computational tools to bolster my software development expertise.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on: Exciting projects that involve hardware-software integration, AI-enhanced design, and any initiatives that push the boundaries of current technology. If you're working on something cutting-edge in these fields, I'd love to connect and contribute!
- 📫 How to reach me: Feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn (https://www.linkedin.com/in/yashaswikatne/). I'm always open to discussions, collaborations, and new opportunities.
- ⚡ Fun fact: When I'm not immersed in code or hardware schematics, you'll likely find me exploring the beautiful hiking trails of Portland or experimenting with new recipes in my kitchen. I believe in maintaining a balance between rigorous academics and rejuvenating hobbies!
